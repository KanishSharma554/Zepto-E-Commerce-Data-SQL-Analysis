# Zepto-E-Commerce-Data-SQL-Analysis
This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis on Zepto’s product and pricing dataset using **SQL**.   The goal was to simulate a real-world business problem where a data analyst is required to extract insights about inventory, discounts, and product performance for an online grocery platform.
