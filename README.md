# Zepto-E-Commerce-Data-SQL-Analysis

This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis on Zepto’s product and pricing dataset using **SQL**.   The goal was to simulate a real-world business problem where a data analyst is required to extract insights about inventory, discounts, and product performance for an online grocery platform. 
The project reflects a typical analytical process used by data professionals in retail or online marketplaces to understand which products perform well, where inventory issues occur, and how discounts influence overall sales.

## What I Worked On

Collected and prepared the Zepto dataset for analysis by importing it into SQL and structuring it into a relational format.
Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, null values, and incorrect entries.
Performed detailed SQL queries to explore product categories, pricing patterns, discount levels, and inventory status.
Created new metrics such as discount percentage and price per gram to measure value-for-money.
Used SQL analytical functions, including CTEs and window functions, to find ranking and comparative patterns among products and categories.
Interpreted the outputs to extract meaningful business conclusions from the data.

## Key Areas of Analysis

Category Performance – Studied which product categories have the most listings, highest discounts, and consistent stock availability.
Discount Patterns – Compared average discounts across categories and analyzed which ones use higher markdowns to attract sales.
Inventory Insights – Identified categories and items that frequently go out of stock or have irregular supply.
Value-for-Money Metric – Calculated price per gram to find the most cost-effective products and detect overpriced items.
Revenue Contribution – Highlighted which product segments contribute the most to potential revenue based on price and stock levels.

## Major Insights

Snacks and Beverages offered the highest average discount rates, showing that promotional pricing plays a key role in this category’s sales.
Fresh Produce faced the most frequent stock shortages, pointing to possible supply chain or demand forecasting challenges.
Products with better value (low price per gram and steady stock) represented nearly one-third of the overall inventory.
Categories with deeper discounts showed faster stock turnover, implying that strategic discounting can improve sales velocity.
Data cleaning revealed several inconsistencies such as duplicate SKUs and missing values that could affect business reporting if not corrected.
